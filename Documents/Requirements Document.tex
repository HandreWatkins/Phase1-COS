		\section{Introduction}
			This document serves to fully specify and 		outline the requirements of the marking-system in detail. The document also serves to give the client and developers a clear description and elaboration of the system to be implemented in its totality. Furthermore, this document formulates an agreement between the client, Mr Jan Kroeze from the Department of Computer Science at the University of Pretoria, and developers with regard to the system to be built.
		\section{Vision}
			The marking system aims to provide lecturers with the opportunity to centralize and digitalize the marking process for practical assessments carried out and evaluated. The system will also allow Teaching Assistants (TAs) and Tutors to access the system during a marking session for a module, to record the marks of students onto the system, through the use of their mobile smartphones or computers. The system will also allow the student to access his or her mark at a later stage to see how much they have acquired. The aim of this system is to remove tedious paperwork and to prevent the loss of marks.
		\section{Background}
			This project is due to the Computer Science department of the University of Pretoria currently facing an abundance of paper work and a potential loss of mark sheets and the opportunity of utilising the COS 301 course learning opportunity for the creation of an online marking system. The system is intended to improve the marking procedures currently in place within the Computer Science department and simplify the process of processing and distributing marks as they are released. The system also provides the COS 301 students with the opportunity to learn more with regards to the procedure used for creating, designing and developing projects for businesses while also providing the University with a potentially new system that may in future be used throughout the entire university.

			\subsection{Integration requirements}
			The Integration channel section will cover all information in regards to the program interfacing with the multiple systems, what systems will be involved in the program and how this interfacing will be done. Integration channels refer to the endpoints that are created in the system and the interfaces and interface channels to realize this program. Integration with the multiple areas of the system will play a major part in the connection of the device, website and the database aspects.

			\textbf{Integration channel}\\
			Integration will be facilitated between the website, mobile application and databases. The database will serve as the endpoint in most of the user cases and only be seen as a middle step in the retrieval of marks form the student and lecturer side. The hosted database will be a MySQL database (as per client specification) and will interface to the ALDOP to retrieve student, tutor and lecturer information. 

			All applications will have internet requirements as with the mark, mark sheet and change logs will be uploaded via the internet to a local database that stores mark information. Mobile device, internet connection will be used in this regard to connect to the DNS of the local storage server. The website will be hosted in concert with the database and PHP can be used for server side data transfer.

			Both the website and mobile application is required to do real time uploads to the database if internet connection can be made and will require a constant syncing of information. The information stored on the database will be accessible from both website and mobile application to view individual marks and final marks. This data will be used by the reporting tools to generate the graphs and statistical information. A failsafe must be included for the mobile application if internet connectivity is not available the application must continue until the end of the current mark sheet. This must allow a batch upload of the marks. The batch size must be no more than the size of the current mark sheet and has to be checked against the timestamp that is included in the version of the database at that time.

			Dynamic roles will be allocated from the data interface to the ALDOP system. The marking process can only be started by lecturers and tutors. Viewing of marks will be available to students in a personal capacity, a student can only see his or her mark. A lecturer will only be able to view the marks in a group capacity.

			\textbf{Protocols}\\
The protocols include all integration tools that will be used in the development of the program. 
			\begin{description}
				\item \tab [$\bullet$] FTP	
				\item \tab [$\bullet$] SOAP
				\item \tab [$\bullet$] HTTPS
			\end{description}
			\textbf{API}
			\begin{description}			
				\item API (Application Programming Interface)\\
			\end{description}
			Android\\
			MySQL\\
			ALDOP\\
			\begin{description}
				\item \includegraphics[width=425pt]{IntegrationDiagram}
			\end{description}
			\textbf{Quality requirements}
			\begin{description}			
				\item \tab \textbf{\bf Performance}
				\item \tab \textsc{The interaction with the database must be able to host all students, tutors, teaching assistance within the IT faculty. This integration must be done so that there is no decrease in performance}
			\end{description}
			\begin{description}			
				\item \tab \textbf{\bf Security}
				\item \tab \textsc{The interface must be secure and only interaction from a registered user via the mobile application or the website will be allowed. All interactions must be logged in a way that is accessible by staff but cannot be edited.}
			\end{description}
			\begin{description}			
				\item \tab \textbf{\bf Usability}
				\item \tab \textsc{All registered personnel at the facility of IT must be able to use the website or application as long as the minimum requirements have been met.}
				\item \tab \textsc{The user must:}
				\begin{description}
					\item [$\bullet$] Be a student, tutor, teaching assistant or lecturer at the Faculty of Information Technology
					\item [$\bullet$] Have an active internet connection via Pc or a mobile device running android (Minimum API level to be confirmed)
				\end{description}
			\end{description}

			\subsection{Architecture constraints}
				The constraints regarding the architecture of the system gives us a boundary or 	barrier outlining the system, and specifying our design within certain limitations.
According to the client, constraints in the system exist both on the hardware and software of the application.

				\textbf{Hardware Constraints}\\
				Firstly the system needs to be able to function on any personal computer. On this type of hardware the user will access the system via a browser using the internet.
 
				The system also needs to be able to run on any tablet available and should also be accessible through a browser, but more likely through an Android Application.

				Lastly, the system will need to function on a mobile phone. Older phones might only be able to access the system from a browser, where newer smartphones should be able to access it both from a browser as well as an Android Application.\pagebreak
				
				\textbf{Software Constraints}\\
				The software constraints of the system are discussed a bit more and form a larger part of the boundary,so that we may better understand where and how we are limited. The technologies that must be used in this system are specified as the following:
				\begin{description}
					\item \tab [$\bullet$] On web based systems, the application needs to function on all browsers available as well as all the versions of these browsers.
					\item \tab [$\bullet$] Android is the only app based system that an app needs to be designed for.
					\item \tab [$\bullet$] MySQL will be used as database to store all the information such as marks and other student related information.
					\item \tab [$\bullet$] GitHub will be used for a web based repository to store all of the information regarding the project.
					\item \tab [$\bullet$] LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) will be used as a user database that requires only a single sign on password.
					\item \tab [$\bullet$] Python programming language should be used to create the system.
					\item \tab [$\bullet$] Django must be used as a web framework, which is written in python, to complete the web based systems.
					\item \tab [$\bullet$] SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) will be used as interface for exchanging information on the web services and across the network.
					\item \tab [$\bullet$] UTF-8 must be used for encoding to keep information safe and secure.
					\item \tab [$\bullet$] Audit trials must be followed for all access made to the system.	
				\end{description}

		\section{Functional requirements}
			\subsection{Introduction}
			The system will require the user to be a Student, Teaching Assistant, Lecturer or HOD at the Department of Computer Science at the University of Pretoria. It will allow the students to review their progress of marks obtained from practical assignments and progress marks of the semester as well. The Teaching Assistants will be allowed to mark the students during a practical and upload the marks and then to be added to the studentâ€™s mark list, the marks are also editable by the TA provided the mark sheet is not locked by the Lecturer. The Lecturer will be able to set up a practical and mark sheet that can be edited during the allocated time of the practical, the Lecturer will be able to review the studentâ€™s submissions and the marks and make changes where it is required. The HOD will be able to add and remove Lecturers from modules provided they are employed at the Department of Computer Science; he/she will have access to any module and review the content of any practical. Any changes made will be updated to the audit log.
			\subsection{Scope and Limitations/Exclusions}

						\item Keep all the marks on a centralized database.
					\end{enumerate}
					The system shall be designed primarily for use by heads of departments, lecturers, teaching assistants, tutors, and students for the core and sole purpose of viewing, inputting and modifying student marks in a centralized environment.

				\textsc{\bf Exclusions}
					\begin{description}
						\item The following exclusions are made explicit:
						\begin{description}
							\item \tab [$\bullet$] The system does not allow for assessments to be uploaded onto the system for auto marking.
							\item \tab [$\bullet$] The system strictly allows for mark-inputting by markers.
						\end{description}
 					\end{description}
 				\pagebreak
				\textsc{\bf Limitations}
					\begin{description}
						\item The following limitations are made explicit:

					\begin{enumerate}
						\item Elaboration - This process will allow the HOD to add lecturers in his department to the system and validate them as lecturers for their respective modules.
						\item Importance - 4.
						\item Dependency level - Without this feature, the entire system is unusable as lecturers cannot assign TAs and tutors to mark students using the system, hence the client request is not satisfied.
						\item Pre-condition - This feature on the system will be properly implemented using appropriate technology.
						\item Post-condition - This feature functions as it should with no defects or short-comings.
						\item Requestor - Client.
					\end{enumerate}

					\includegraphics[width=380pt]{requiredFunc7}
					\item To lock and finalize mark sheets for marking sessions once the session is complete.
					\begin{enumerate}
						\item Elaboration - This process involves the system automatically locking a mark-sheet after practical session is compete, or the lecturer locking the mark-sheet himself/herself.
						\item Importance - 3.
						\item Dependency level - Without this process, markers may alter mark sheets whenever they wish, even long after the assessment was assessed, which poses security and validity threats.
						\item Pre-condition - This feature on the system will be properly implemented using appropriate technology.
						\item Post-condition - This feature functions as it should with no defects or short-comings.
						\item Requestor - Client.
					\end{enumerate}

					\end{enumerate}
					\includegraphics[width=380pt]{requiredFunc9}\\
					\includegraphics[width=380pt]{requiredFunc9_1}
					\pagebreak
					\item To alter studentsâ€™ marks on the system
					\begin{enumerate}
						\item Elaboration - This process describes a marker altering a student mark on the system after having already recorded a mark for the student. There shall be an audit book that will keep records of every edit that is being done on the mark sheet(s). It will only record changes that happens when the marks are being edited on the mark sheet(s).
						\item Importance - 3.
						\item Dependency level - This process allows markers to correct a studentâ€™s mark which has been incorrectly recorded on the system. As the client wishes that lecturers have minimal to zero interaction with the mark-recording-process, this process is rather necessary.
						\item Pre-condition - This feature on the system will be properly implemented using appropriate technology.
						\item Post-condition - This feature functions as it should with no defects or short-comings.
						\item Requestor - Client.
					\end{enumerate}

					\begin{enumerate}
					\item Elaboration â€“ This process describes students, lecturers, and the HOD being able to view a studentâ€™s marks on the system. Student marks should be visible as individual and cumulative marks till any given point in time. These marks should also have statistical measures and graphical representations such as graphs.
					\item Importance â€“ 4
					\item Dependency level â€“ Without this process, the purpose of the system is defeated.
					\item Pre-condition â€“ This feature on the system will be properly implemented using appropriate technology.
					\item Post-condition â€“ This feature functions as it should with no defects or short-comings.
					\item Requestor â€“ Client.

					\end{enumerate}
					\includegraphics[width=380pt]{requiredFunc12}\\
					\includegraphics[width=380pt]{requiredFunc12_1}
					\item Search ability
					\begin{enumerate}
					\item The system shall be able to allow users to search using key words such as name, surname and students number. The keeps the history of what has been searched for on that session.

			\subsection{Use case/Services contracts}
				\textbf{Pre-conditions:}\\
				A few conditions must be met before any of the users can access and use the system.
				\begin{description}
					\item \tab [$\bullet$] The user must have a functioning device capable of running the system. Devices may be a personal computer, a tablet or a mobile phone.

				\end{description}
				\pagebreak
				\textbf{Request and Results Data Structures}\\
				The data structures that are being used in the system are closely linked and interleaved to form the structure of the system and give it the most core of functionality. The system will need to receive some form of input from the users to process and generate the expected output.\\
				The requests of the system will be the basic input that will need to be provided by the users, whether it is the students, tutors or lecturers. A few basic and fundamental inputs will be:
				\begin{description}
					\item \tab [$\bullet$] Students will have to provide their username and password to LDAP to gain access to the system.
					\item \tab [$\bullet$] Also students will have to choose which mark to view and in what format it should be viewed.
					\item \tab [$\bullet$] Tutors will also have to provide their specially assigned username and password to LDAP to access the system.
					\item \tab [$\bullet$] The tutors will need to provide the current studentâ€™s student number that is being marked, along with the allocated mark for the determined practical.
					\item \tab [$\bullet$] The tutors need to provide a reason for changing the mark of a student along with the changed mark.
					\item \tab [$\bullet$] The lecturers will once again need to provide their username and password to LDAP to gain access to the system.
					\item \tab [$\bullet$] The lecturers will have to provide marks when adding and editing them along with the studentâ€™s student number and what individual mark needs to be altered.
					\item \tab [$\bullet$] The lecturer will also need a newly added studentâ€™s information to add new students as well as removing them from the system.
					\item \tab [$\bullet$] The head of department will once again need to provide their username and password to LDAP to gain access to the system.
					\item \tab [$\bullet$] The head of department will have to provide marks when adding and editing them along with the studentâ€™s student number and what individual mark needs to be altered.
					\item \tab [$\bullet$] The head of department will also need a newly added studentâ€™s information to add new students as well as removing them from the system.
					\item \tab [$\bullet$] The head of department needs to provide a time and location to create a practical and add it to the system.
					\item \tab [$\bullet$] The head of department will have to provide details when he/she wants to add a new feature to the system.
					\item \tab [$\bullet$] The head of department will have to provide the tutor details that needs to be added or removed from the system.
				\end{description}
The result of the system are much simpler as it produces more or less what the user wants to achieve from the system. The results of the system will be:
				\begin{description}
					\item \tab [$\bullet$] The student will be able to view his/her marks individually as well as calculated together.
					\item \tab [$\bullet$] The tutor will be able to view the marks of the student, and also know if the alteration and adding of marks was successful.
					\item \tab [$\bullet$] The lecturer will be able to view all of the database information of the students and an audit trail of any alteration of marks on the system.
					\item \tab [$\bullet$] The head of department will be able to view all information regarding the marks and students as well as an audit trail for alteration of marks.
					\item \tab [$\bullet$] The head of department will also receive reports regarding the system in a timely manner.

		\section{Open Issues}
		\textbf{Requirements still to be specified}\\
		No further requirements need be specified.\\
		\vspace{0.05cm}\\
		\textbf{Clarification Required}\\
		The following points still need to be clarified with the client:
		\begin{description}
			\item \tab [$\bullet$] Regarding the pooled-notifications for students, should a batch be sent periodically to students or should students simply check their marks on the system when they need and want to?
			\item \tab [$\bullet$] Who can upload .csv files to the system? Only the lecturer or all markers?
		\end{description}
		\vspace{0.3cm}
		\textbf{Requirements inconsistencies}\\
		The following inconsistencies where identified in the requirements:
		\begin{description}			
			\item \tab [$\bullet$] TAâ€™s and Tutors can alter student marks by providing reasons when they do so. The client has indicated that Lecturers can decide on the privileges assigned to TAs and Tutors. However, TAs and Tutors only have two core roles which define their purpose on the system; recording student marks and altering/updating studenft marks(with reason). What privileges can the Lecturer then decide on, as removing any of these roles from a TA or Tutor possibly defeats the role of a TA or Tutor on the system, which in turn possibly defeats the clientâ€™s purpose for the system, which is to have the TAs and Tutors deals with as much of the mark recording as possible.
