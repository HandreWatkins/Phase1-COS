		\section{Introduction}
			This document serves to fully specify and 		outline the requirements of the marking-system in detail. The document also serves to give the client and developers a clear description and elaboration of the system to be implemented in its totality. Furthermore, this document formulates an agreement between the client, Mr Jan Kroeze from the Department of Computer Science at the University of Pretoria, and developers with regard to the system to be built.
		\section{Vision}
			The marking system aims to provide lecturers with the opportunity to centralize and digitalize the marking process for practical assessments carried out and evaluated. The system will also allow Teaching Assistants (TAs) and Tutors to access the system during a marking session for a module, to record the marks of students onto the system, through the use of their mobile smartphones or computers. The system will also allow the student to access his or her mark at a later stage to see how much they have acquired. The aim of this system is to remove tedious paperwork and to prevent the loss of marks.
		\section{Background}
			This project is due to the Computer Science department of the University of Pretoria currently facing an abundance of paper work and a potential loss of mark sheets and the opportunity of utilising the COS 301 course learning opportunity for the creation of an online marking system. The system is intended to improve the marking procedures currently in place within the Computer Science department and simplify the process of processing and distributing marks as they are released. The system also provides the COS 301 students with the opportunity to learn more with regards to the procedure used for creating, designing and developing projects for businesses while also providing the University with a potentially new system that may in future be used throughout the entire university.

		\section{Functional requirements}
			\subsection{Introduction}
			The system will require the user to be a Student, Teaching Assistant, Lecturer or HOD at the Department of Computer Science at the University of Pretoria. It will allow the students to review their progress of marks obtained from practical assignments and progress marks of the semester as well. The Teaching Assistants will be allowed to mark the students during a practical and upload the marks and then to be added to the student’s mark list, the marks are also editable by the TA provided the mark sheet is not locked by the Lecturer. The Lecturer will be able to set up a practical and mark sheet that can be edited during the allocated time of the practical, the Lecturer will be able to review the student’s submissions and the marks and make changes where it is required. The HOD will be able to add and remove Lecturers from modules provided they are employed at the Department of Computer Science; he/she will have access to any module and review the content of any practical. Any changes made will be updated to the audit log.
			\subsection{Scope and Limitations/Exclusions}
				\textsc{\bf Scope}\\
					The scope of the Marking System project can be encapsulated as a solution that allows the users of the system to:
					\begin{enumerate}
						\item Record the practical assignments of the students.
						\item To view the marks of the practical assignments at a later stage.
						\item Keep all the marks on a centralized database.
					\end{enumerate}
					The system shall be designed primarily for use by heads of departments, lecturers, teaching assistants, tutors, and students for the core and sole purpose of viewing, inputting and modifying student marks in a centralized environment.

				\textsc{\bf Exclusions}
					\begin{description}
						\item The following exclusions are made explicit:
						\begin{description}
							\item \tab [$\bullet$] The system does not allow for assessments to be uploaded onto the system for auto marking.

						\end{description}
 					\end{description}
				\textsc{\bf Limitations}
					\begin{description}
						\item The following limitations are made explicit:
						\begin{description}
